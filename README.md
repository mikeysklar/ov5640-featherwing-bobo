**OV5640 FeatherWing BoBo** was created to solve a real-world wiring problem discussed on the [Adafruit](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=221951) f(https://github.com/jerryneedell/mycamera). Wiring 18 pins by hand is a messy process.

Special thanks to [jerryn for his reference design and example code](https://github.com/jerryneedell/mycamera).
